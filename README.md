# EWH HACKS

## Setup
First install Node and npm. Then run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Running
To build the project, run `npm run build`. The output will be in `dist/`.

While developing, it's useful to have the project build automatically after any
changes. To do this, run `npm start`.
